# ICM Structure Registry — Index

This directory is the **single source of truth** for four skills:
`project-brief`, `adopt-project`, `project-scaffold`, and `session-learnings`.
Each project **type** has exactly one file here. To change how a type is classified,
scaffolded, or maintained, edit **that one file** — all the skills read it, so they stay
in sync automatically. See `MAINTAINING.md` (beside this file) for the interdependency contract.

> **Where this registry lives.** It ships bundled inside the `interpretable-context` plugin at
> `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/registry/`. Skills resolve any registry file with a **user-override-first**
> lookup: use `~/.claude/icm/registry/<file>` if it exists, otherwise the bundled copy. That lets a
> user customize or add a type locally without editing the plugin (and survive plugin updates).

> ICM = Interpretable Context Methodology: folder structure *is* the agent's architecture.
> Five layers — L0 `CLAUDE.md` (identity/map), L1 `CONTEXT.md` (routing), L2 workspace/stage
> `CONTEXT.md` (contract), L3 reference material (stable, recurring — "the factory"),
> L4 working artifacts (per-run, one-off — "the product").

## How the skills use this directory

1. **`project-brief`** reads the **Type Table** below to classify a new project, then loads
   that one type's file for its **Brief question set** (§3).
2. **`adopt-project`** (existing-repo path) classifies via the **Type Table**, then loads that
   type's **Brief question set** (§3) and its **existing-repo mapping** (§10) to inventory the repo.
3. **`project-scaffold`** reads the declared `type` from a project's `PROJECT-BRIEF.md`, then
   loads that one type's file for the **folder tree** (§4), **layer map** (§5),
   **templates** (§6–7), and — for brownfield overlays — the **existing-repo mapping** (§10).
4. **`session-learnings`** reads `.icm/manifest.md` for the project's `type`, then loads that
   one type's file for its **learning-routing rules** (§9).

**Load only the one relevant type file, on demand.** Never read all of them; never force-load
a type file with `@`-embeds. (This is the deliberate, justified exception to "skills are
self-contained" — a shared registry is what keeps the three skills interdependent-by-design.)

## Type Table — the classifier's lookup

| type | shape | status | one-line identity | match signals |
|------|-------|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| `coding` | workspace | complete | Build a software application (web / mobile / API / CLI). | app, application, website, web app, mobile app, API, backend, service, SaaS, dashboard, tool, "build software", feature, bug, deploy, frontend, fullstack |
| `content` | pipeline | stub | Produce written/media content through a publishing pipeline. | blog, article, newsletter, video, post, content, publish, editorial, writing, podcast |
| `client` | workspace | stub | Manage deliverables for an external client / engagement. | client, engagement, retainer, deliverable, account, agency, stakeholder, consulting |
| `business-opportunity` | pipeline | stub | Evaluate / develop a business idea or opportunity. | business idea, opportunity, market, validate, go-to-market, monetize, startup, venture |

`status: stub` types are **recognizable but not fully built**. When the classifier lands on a
stub, `project-brief` must tell the user the type isn't fully set up yet and offer to either
proceed minimally or treat it as the closest `complete` type (usually `coding`).

## Registry-file FORMAT SPEC — follow this exactly when adding or editing a type

Every type file MUST contain these sections, in this order:

| # | Section | Consumed by | Required contents |
|---|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| FM | Frontmatter | all | `type` (kebab-case, == filename stem), `version` (integer, bump on any change), `shape` (`workspace` \| `pipeline`), `match_signals` (list), `status` (`complete` \| `stub`) |
| 1 | Identity | project-brief | What this type is; when to use it (plain language) |
| 2 | Match signals | project-brief | Strong signals + weak/ambiguous ones (confirm-don't-assume) for the classifier |
| 3 | Brief question set | project-brief | Markdown table, columns: `id`, `prompt` (plain language), `source` (`user-only` \| `researchable`), `required` (yes/no), `maps_to` (target structure slot/file). **The `required: yes` rows ARE the validation contract for BOTH project-brief (final check) and project-scaffold (re-check) — now also machine-checked by `icm validate` (the `maps_to` binding) and `icm lint`.** |
| 4 | Folder tree | project-scaffold, session-learnings | Exact tree to create, layer-annotated, with `{slots}` filled from the brief |
| 5 | Layer map | project-scaffold, session-learnings | Table mapping every path to L0/L1/L2/L3/L4 |
| 6 | CLAUDE.md template (L0) | project-scaffold | Map-only template with `{slots}`; keep < 200 lines; **NO routing table**. Its **Avoid** section must be authored as **`### Hard constraints`** (user guardrails, incl. the secrets baseline) + **`### Soft defaults`** (researched/assumed defaults & the scope/off-stack/refactor baselines — each carrying a date + provenance, revisitable: ARA §7.4), and is **never empty** (see "Avoid is a guardrail" below). |
| 7 | CONTEXT.md templates | project-scaffold | Root router (L1, **NO folder map**) + one per workspace/stage (L2): What-this-is / What-to-load (Load + Skip) / Folder / Process / Skills & Tools / What-NOT-to-do. **Skills & Tools carries the type's recommended-skill baseline** (emit even if not installed — the scaffold prompts with install links; see "Route tasks to capabilities" below) plus one row per brief `known_tools` entry. Workspaces with recurring diagnostic work also carry a **Known Gotchas** section (symptom → likely cause → fix/check) that §9 routes `gotcha` learnings into. |
| 8 | Naming conventions | project-scaffold, session-learnings | File-naming patterns table |
| 9 | Learning-routing rules | session-learnings | Table: category → recurrence test → destination file+section → insert format; plus an explicit **DISCARD** row for one-offs. A `thing-to-avoid` routes to `CLAUDE.md` → Avoid → **Soft defaults** (never Hard), with date + `provenance: learned`. A `gotcha` routes to the nearest workspace's **Known Gotchas** section as `symptom → likely cause → fix/check`. |
| 10 | Existing-repo mapping (brownfield) | adopt-project, project-scaffold (overlay) | How to recognize an existing repo's parts and map them onto this type's ICM layers **without moving files**: which files reveal the researchable fields, and which existing dirs map to which workspace/layer |

### Avoid is a guardrail, not paperwork (applies to every type)
The L0 `CLAUDE.md` **Avoid** section steers every future session away from the wrong tech, scope, or
areas it shouldn't touch. So it should **almost never be empty**: each type's §6 template defines a
small set of **baseline avoids** (scope, off-stack tech, secrets, unrelated refactors) that always
render, and `project-brief` / `adopt-project` **propose project-specific avoids/constraints the
baselines don't already cover** when the user names none (de-dupe overlaps — keep the specific one).
Treat an empty Avoid as a sign the brief missed something — dig, don't pass.

### Route tasks to capabilities, not just folders (applies to every type)
A router that stops at *task → workspace* leaves the agent to rediscover HOW to do the work every
session. So the L2 contracts also route to **capabilities**:
- **Skills & Tools is a curated baseline per type** — the skills a session should reach for in that
  workspace, emitted **even when not currently installed**. The scaffold checks availability after
  generating and prompts the user to install what's missing (install links live in the type file's
  §7 table footnotes and survive into the generated files). The baseline is non-negotiable by
  default but registry-owned: override the type file in `~/.claude/icm/registry/` to change it.
  Brief `known_tools` entries each add a row to the most relevant workspace's table.
- **Known Gotchas is per-workspace diagnostic memory** (`symptom → likely cause → fix/check`).
  Any workspace with recurring diagnostic work gets one; the router and What-to-Load rows for
  diagnostic tasks point at it FIRST, before reasoning from scratch, and §9 routes `gotcha`
  learnings into it so it compounds. Debugging code is the `coding` instance; the same pattern
  applies to any type's diagnosis-shaped work (a client's recurring objections, a content format
  that keeps underperforming, a deploy that fails the same way).

### Validation & provenance (`icm lint` / `icm validate`)
The structure is **machine-checked** — and mechanically, not by LLM judgment (ARA found mechanical
checks catch ~100% of injected defects vs ~22% for an LLM-judged check):
- **`icm lint`** validates each type file against this FORMAT SPEC (`status: complete` strictly,
  `status: stub` leniently — a stub passes, its TODO sections are reported as info). Run it after
  editing a type: `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/icm" lint --type <type> --strict`.
- **`icm validate project <dir>`** validates a scaffolded/overlaid project: no unfilled `{slots}`,
  the L0/L1 split, every router target resolves, every required field's value landed (the `maps_to`
  binding), the manifest is well-formed, and — brownfield — that **no pre-existing file was modified**
  (re-hashing `.icm/baseline.json`). `project-scaffold` runs it in a generate→validate→fix loop.

Both are **registry-driven** — they parse the type file and never hardcode a type — so completing a
stub or adding a type needs **no validator change** (the same property as "No skill code changes" below).

**Provenance vocabulary** (used by the brief's Structure Manifest and the Avoid Hard/Soft split):
`user` · `user-confirmed-default` · `assumed-default` · `inferred-from-repo` (brownfield) · `learned`
(session-learnings) · `scaffold-baseline` (a §6 template baseline avoid).

### The layer split (do not violate)
- **`CLAUDE.md` (L0) = THE MAP.** Always loaded → every line costs tokens in every conversation.
  Identity, folder tree, naming, commands, avoid, current-state. Keep < 200 lines. **No routing tables.**
- **Root `CONTEXT.md` (L1) = THE ROUTER.** Loaded on navigation. Task→workspace table, workspace
  summary, cross-workspace flow. ~30–50 lines. **No folder map, no naming rules.**
- **Workspace `CONTEXT.md` (L2) = THE CONTRACT.** What this workspace is, what to load/skip,
  its process, its skills, what not to do.

### Shape conventions
- **`workspace`** → parallel **named** folders (e.g. `coding`: planning/src/docs/ops). Root
  `CONTEXT.md` routes by task → workspace.
- **`pipeline`** → sequential **numbered** stages `NN_*` (e.g. `01_ideas/ → 02_drafts/ → …`),
  usually under a `stages/` folder with its own stage-router `CONTEXT.md`. Each stage's output
  feeds the next. The folder SHAPE differs; the L0–L4 PRINCIPLES are identical.

## Adding a new type — checklist

1. Copy an existing file (or a stub) to `registry/<new-type>.md` (bundled), or to
   `~/.claude/icm/registry/<new-type>.md` to add it just for yourself.
2. Fill all 10 sections + frontmatter following the FORMAT SPEC above.
3. Add a row to the **Type Table** (type, shape, status, identity, match signals).
4. Set `status: complete` and `version: 1` when the type is fully usable.
5. **No skill code changes are needed** — the skills pick up the new file automatically.

When you change an existing type's structure, also update its §3 questions and §9
learning-routing in the **same file** (they live together so they can't drift). Bump `version`.
